TooSlides

A project showing how to create a simple javascript plugin

Getting Started

Get started by downloading the content of this repo. There are two main files of concern: tooslide.js and tooslide.css.
Link both files to the page where you want a slider:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tooSlide.css"> <script src="tooslide.is">

Using the plugin
The plugin works by converting a list of images on a page to a slider.

Steps
1. Create a container element that will house all sliding images e.g <div class="sliderContainer"></div>
2. Inside the container, add a new div for each image to be used e.g <div class="singleSlide"><img src="path-to-image"></div>
3. Initialize the plugin
